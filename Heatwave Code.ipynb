This change is impacting local climates all around the world. In this project, we will examine temperature change in India and its different sub-national units. The purpose of this project is to unveil the impacts of climate change and manifest them through visualizations and analyses.\nLet us first learn more about climate change, its causes and its effects.\n\n__What is climate change?__<br>\n\"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\"[<sub>[1]</sub>](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change#:~:text=Climate%20change%20refers%20to%20long,like%20coal%2C%20oil%20and%20gas.)\n\n__What are its causes?__<br>\n\"The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like burning fossil fuels, like natural gas, oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases what are called greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere. There, these gases trap heat from the sun’s rays inside the atmosphere causing Earth’s average temperature to rise. This rise in the planet's temperature is called global warming. The warming of the planet impacts local and regional climates. Throughout Earth's history, climate has continually changed. When occurring naturally, this is a slow process that has taken place over hundreds and thousands of years. The human-influenced climate change that is happening now is occurring at a much faster rate.\"[<sub>[2]</sub>](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/climate-change)\n\n__What are its effects?__<br>\n\"Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.\nEffects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea-level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.\"[<sub>[3]</sub>](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <u>Content</u>\n1.

The IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC) suggests the period 1961-1990 to be used as the baseline period.

I tried to visualize temperature change in India and find trends and patterns of the same and how it varies over different states and union territories.\n\nI found that all States & UTs in India have experienced a continuous increase in temperature in the last decade. 22 out of 33 ( ≈ 67%) States & UTs have experienced a temperature change of more than 0.5 °C. Island groups ( Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar) are the most impacted by temperature change. Southern and northern regions have witnessed maximum changes, whereas Eastern and North-Eastern states have experienced the least.<br>\nThe temperature change trend in India (as a whole) shows a continuous temperature rise, particularly in the last few decades. A look at the seasonal temperature change reveals that the winters witnessed the most erratic temperature changes followed by summer, post-monsoon and monsoon.\n\nThe IPCC Working Group II's report titled 'Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability' [<sub>[10]</sub>](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-ii/) goes into depth regarding all climate-related threats to agriculture and food systems in parts of Asia.<br>\nThe study also mentions that under RCP8.5 (high emissions scenario), at the end of the century, Lucknow and Patna are among the cities predicted to reach wet-bulb temperatures of 35 degrees if emissions continue to rise, while Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Mumbai, Indore and Ahmedabad are all identified as at risk of reaching wet-bulb temperatures of 32-34 degrees with continued emissions.<br>\nOverall, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab will be the most severely affected, but if emissions continue to increase, all Indian states will have regions that experience wet-bulb 30 degrees or more by the end of the century.\n\nThe conclusion is that India is already experiencing a warming climate. Unusual and unprecedented spells of hot weather are expected to occur far more frequently and cover much larger areas.\nUnder 4°C warming, the west coast and southern India are projected to shift to new, high-temperature climatic regimes with significant impacts on agriculture.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id= '14'></a><br>\n## <u>References</u>\n\n[1].
